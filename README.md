# Safe Driving ðŸš—

**A machine learning project for detecting Tunisian car license plates and assessing driver safety.**

## Description

Safe Driving is a machine learning project aimed at reducing road accidents by detecting Tunisian car license plates and determining whether the driver is in a safe driving condition or not. The project uses **YOLOv5** for license plate detection and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to assess driver safety. The target audience for this project are drivers who wish to ensure their safety and improve their driving conditions.

## Problem Statement

Road accidents are a major concern, and one of the causes is distracted driving. By detecting whether a driver is in a safe driving condition, this project aims to help prevent such incidents. 

## Features

- **License Plate Detection**: Detects the license plate of Tunisian cars using YOLOv5.
- **Safe Driving Detection**: Assesses whether the driver is in a safe driving condition using a CNN.
- **Results Metrics**: The model achieves a precision of **97%** and a recall of **95%**.
- **Visual Outputs**: The model provides plots and graphs to visualize the results during training.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rippouzza/Data-Science-Project-.git
   cd Data-Science-Project-
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies** (preferably in a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the datasets** using the links provided below.

## Datasets

- **License Plate Dataset**: [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g2PNTPh2el3YdJEFW0NZ55UBN1dzZTwi?usp=drive_link)
- **Distracted Drivers Dataset**: [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikoaro/distracteddriver/data)

## How to Run

1. Open the notebooks in **Google Colab** (recommended for better performance).
2. Follow the instructions in each notebook to train the models and evaluate the results.
3. The model will output visualizations such as graphs and charts once training is complete.

## Results

- **Precision**: 97%
- **Recall**: 95%

These results are achieved by using **YOLOv5** for license plate detection and a **CNN** model for assessing driver safety. 

## Demo

You can view a demo of the project in the `demo` folder. The video showcases the application in action.

## Challenges and Limitations

- **Challenge**: The main challenge was training the models to work with Tunisian-specific license plates and correctly identifying distracted driving behavior.
- **Limitation**: Currently, the model is tailored to Tunisian license plates and might not work well for other countriesâ€™ plates.
